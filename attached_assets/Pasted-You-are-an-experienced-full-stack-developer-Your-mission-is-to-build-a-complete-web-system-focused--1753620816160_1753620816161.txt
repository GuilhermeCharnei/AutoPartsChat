You are an experienced full-stack developer. Your mission is to build a complete web system focused on automating sales via WhatsApp. The system will be used by an auto parts store.

üìå Important notes:
The entire interface must be in Brazilian Portuguese.

The layout must closely follow the visual style of WhatsApp Web, especially for the chat interface and sidebar.

üõ†Ô∏è System Features:
1. WhatsApp Web-style Chatbot Interface:
Automatically responds to customers through WhatsApp Web or API.

Retrieves product data in real time from a database (based on uploaded Excel sheet).

Transfers the customer to a human seller after answering basic questions or completing a product selection.

2. Admin Panel:
Login with secure authentication.

Upload Excel spreadsheet to update product inventory.

Manual product creation/editing.

View and edit inventory data in real time.

Manage users (sellers) with role-based permissions (e.g., checkboxes to allow access to reports, inventory, etc.).

3. Seller Panel:
Interface must resemble WhatsApp Web.

Sellers receive notifications when a chatbot hands off a customer.

Sellers can view full conversation history.

Can finalize orders and confirm payments.

Can manually add products not listed in the spreadsheet.

Product search and inventory check integrated.

4. Database:
PostgreSQL or Supabase is preferred.

Automatically sync inventory when Excel spreadsheet is uploaded.

Inventory stock must decrement automatically after a sale is completed.

Data should be structured by product, category, price, description, and available quantity.

5. Reports & Analytics:
Reports by seller, date, and sales volume.

Performance metrics like: total sales, conversion rates, orders handled by the bot, etc.

6. Mobile Compatibility:
The system must have a responsive layout that works well on phones and tablets.

UI elements should adapt to smaller screens while maintaining the WhatsApp Web-like experience.
