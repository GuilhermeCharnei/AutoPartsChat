Create a production-ready web application called MVPChat for a Brazilian auto parts distributor named Motormax.

The entire system must be in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**.

üü¢ Layout:
The layout must be very similar to WhatsApp Web: a left sidebar with the company logo, navigation menu, and chat/contact list. The main area must display conversations and forms (chat, CRM, product catalog, etc). Use modern and clean UI components with responsive design.

üß† Chatbot:
Include an integrated chatbot capable of:
- Answering product-related questions automatically
- Recommending products
- Handling customer service up to a certain point before transferring to a human seller
- Working 24/7 without human intervention
- Reducing the number of required salespeople

üí¨ Chat System:
- WhatsApp-style interface
- Allow manual messages from sellers
- Show product suggestions during chat
- Allow creating sales orders directly from the chat

üì¶ Product Catalog:
- Include products with images, descriptions, and prices
- Organized by categories
- Searchable inside the chat or catalog view
- Show real-time stock levels

üìù Sales Orders:
- Allow sellers or chatbot to generate sales orders
- Show product list, subtotal, discounts, taxes, and total
- Store orders in the database with status tracking

üë§ User Roles:
- Admin: full access to all features
- Seller: access to chat, catalog, and orders
- Supervisor: access to metrics and dashboards

üìä Metrics Dashboard:
The system must include a dashboard panel with the following data:
1. General Overview:
   - Total messages handled by the bot
   - Sales generated by the chatbot
   - Sales finalized by sellers
   - Conversion rate (leads x sales)
   - Average bot handling time
   - Time to finalize orders

2. Product Metrics:
   - Most viewed products
   - Most sold products
   - Products with low stock
   - Sales trends by category

3. Customer Metrics:
   - Total unique customers
   - Returning customers
   - Geographic distribution (if possible)
   - Feedback ratings (if collected)

4. Seller Metrics:
   - Sales per seller
   - Average response time
   - Performance chart

5. Chatbot Performance:
   - Successful conversations (bot-only)
   - Handover to seller rate
   - Unanswered or failed bot queries
   - Most searched keywords

‚òÅÔ∏è Technologies:
You may suggest a stack, but ideally use:
- Supabase for backend (auth, database)
- React or Next.js for frontend
- TailwindCSS or modern CSS framework
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

Make sure to structure the code in a scalable way and use clean architecture. Include instructions to run locally and deploy.

The UI/UX must remain very close to the WhatsApp Web style and be entirely in **Portuguese**.
